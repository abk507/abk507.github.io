        <h2 class="gametext">           With over 200 hours of coding, NeoIinferno is by far my biggest game yet.
            In this hardcore skillfull adventure, death is only a freefall into the infinite depths of a neon hell. But while falling between the demons skyscrappers you manage to invade one of them, and now has a chance to climb back to life. In this 2D platformer, challenge yourself and speedrun to the top.

        <a href="https://flammboo.itch.io/cosmosgrall"><img class="gameimage" src="images/games/cosmosGrall capa.png" alt="CosmosGrall Image"></a>
        <h2 class="gametext">           Made for the 1-week OperaGX gamejam, themed "UFO", competing to have your game on the "no internet" page on the browser.
            CosmosGrall is a fun mix of space-themed arcade minigames, where the only real goal is to have fun breaking records.
            Supporting multiplayer and browse focused, just a fun pastime for when Internet is not collaborating.

        <h2 class="gametext">           Made for the 48-hour GTMK gamejam 2022, themed "Roll of the Dice".<br>
            Slice of Dice was my first attempt at making games for everyone, with a simple gameplay, easy puzzles, simple yet creative mechanics and some accessibility features.<br>
            <br>
            After a long day at the Dice Factory, all you want to do is go home, 5 challenges away.<br>
            The innovative feature is your power to drop parts of your dicy body, maybe to create a stair, maybe a jumpin spot, or just to enter small places.<br>
            Overall a short but fun game.

        <h2 class="gametext">           Made for the 48-hour GTMK gamejam 2020, themed "Out of Controll".<br>
            Mad Zeppelin was my fisrt attempt at actual phy simulations, not so good result<br>
            <br>
            You are the whole tripulation in this zeppelin at mid-flight, plus the are endless enemies up to get this machine on the ground.<br>
            Try to stay up as long as you can while controlling the navigation, both your and the ships health, and the turrets to kill everybody and cause massive chaos on the city.

        <a href="https://flammboo.itch.io/rust-205"><img class="gameimage" src="images/games/banner.png" alt="Rust 205 Image"></a>
        <h2 class="gametext">           Rust 205 is a game changer on my life, for it is my first attempt at 3D games and environments.<br>
            Actually, it's not considered a 3D game entirelly, but a 2.5D, if it is even possible. Rust 205 is a 2D on it's core, all the collisions, environment, movement and programming are 2D, but he has an unique 3D camera that gives perspective to the scenary.
            It all still looks like paper over paper, but now further paper moves slowlyer.<br>
            On Rust 205, the player moves a circle, collecting coins and reaching to flags for 30 puzzle levels, when the game has a plot-twisting end.

        <h2 class="gametext">           I have other few games, some of them I even made about 6 years ago, when all I knew about coding was If, Else and while.<br>
        So if you want to see and may play them, (not recommended)<a href="https://flammboo.itch.io/">click here</a> and have fun. :D</h2>
